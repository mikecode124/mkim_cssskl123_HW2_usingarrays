# Project:      HW2 - USING ARRAYS
# Student:      Michael Kim
# Class:        CSSSKL 123
# Section:      A, Spring 2024
#
#
# In this assignment, we are tasked with reading from a .py file and
# utilizing/manipulating the data within 4 separate lists to perform certain
# operations while use of f/w loop syntax is or is not restricted. Ultimately,
# the data values read in will be displayed and compared via visualizations.
#
# **Comments that specify each numbered task are in, "Main:", which begins
# after the import and methods sections below.**
# =============================================================================


# --> Import module:

import numpy as np
import stocks #allows use of the .py file and its obj contents



# --> Methods:

def percent_of_mean(file):
    pass



# --> Main:

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Task #1:
# - Loops restricted / List comprehension structures restricted
# - Write 'percent_of_mean()'.
#   - Input is a 1-D array of numeric values.
#       - values represent the stock index for each day as a % of the
#           mean value over the period covered by the list
#   - Find mean of all values
#   - Store representation of each value as a % of the mean
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
